## 1. Project Overview

This project is a package for extracting, classifying, and filtering academic papers from various scholarly sources, for literature review,comparative or meta analysis. It includes components for interacting with Google Scholar (through SerpAPI), Scopus (through pybliometrics), and Elsevier APIs, along with: TODO local journal filtering using GPT-based classification via OpenAI.

**Key technologies:**
- Python
- pandas
- OpenAI GPT API
- SerpAPI
- pybliometrics (Scopus)
- (Elsevier client library)

**High-level architecture:**
- Modular extractors for different data providers (Google Scholar, Scopus, Elsevier)
- Shared abstraction layer for paper data
- Paper extraction by query, retrieving meta data (author, title, ..)
TODO extraction of section scraping (by summary, whole document etc..)

---

## 2. Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pip` package manager
- API keys for SerpAPI, Scopus (configured for pybliometrics), Elsevier, and OpenAI..

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r review/requirements.txt
```
(You may need to manually install proprietary/specialized libraries referenced in the code, such as `serpapi`, `pybliometrics`, or a specific Elsevier client. See code comments for guidance.)

### Usage Example
- Run extractors as Python scripts or import their classes in notebooks / workflows
- Example (from a notebook):
    ```python
    from Scripts.drop_extract_papers import main
    df = main(query="machine learning bias", api_key=API_KEY, provider="scopus")
    print(df.head())
    ```
- For journal filtering using GPT (see `journal_filter_gpt.py`):
    ```python
    import openai
    from Scripts.journal_filter_gpt import filter_journal_dataframe
    df_filtered = filter_journal_dataframe(df, client=openai.OpenAI(...), column_names=[...], context_text="...")
    ```
### Running Tests

## 3. Project Structure

- **review/Scripts/extract_papers.py**
  Entry point & implementations for extracting papers from Google Scholar, Scopus, and Elsevier. Includes abstract `PaperExtractor` interface and provider-specific classes.
- **review/Scripts/paper.py**
  Core `Paper` data structure with serialization and helper methods.
- **review/Scripts/journal_filter_gpt.py**
  Filtering/cleaning utilities utilizing OpenAI GPT for classification of journals or other metadata.
- **review/Scripts/bias_scopus.ipynb**
  Jupyter exploratory analysis (Scopus lists, filtering logic, demo)
- **review/data/**
  Source and processed CSV/XLSX paper/journal/lists data
- **review/requirements.txt**
  Python dependency list (not always complete)

**Important config files:**
- `review/requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `.env`/local API key config — not directly present but referenced in code

---

## 4. Development Workflow
- **Coding Standards:**
  Follow PEP8 and SOLID principles for class design (see code comments).
- **Testing:**
  Tests files are grouped
- **Build/Deployment:**
  Not automated; recommend using a Makefile or simple bash scripts for routine tasks.


---

## 5. Key Concepts
- **Paper extraction:**
  Modular, provider-driven approach to acquiring structured paper metadata
- **Abstraction layer:**
  Interfaces and base classes minimize duplication/spaghetti code
- **GPT-based filtering:**
  Large language model inference is used to handle ambiguous/subjective filtering
- **Chunked processing:**
  Large lists broken into smaller groups for manageable GPT API calls

---

## 6. Common Tasks
- **Extract papers from a provider:**
  Use `main()` in `extract_papers.py`; specify provider (`googlescholar`, `scopus`, `elsevier`)
- **Add a new extractor/provider:**
  Inherit from `PaperExtractor`, add to `EXTRACTORS` dictionary
- **Filter a DataFrame of journals:**
  Use `filter_journal_dataframe()` with required client/context/columns
- **Extend paper features:**
  Modify `Paper` in `paper.py` (add fields/methods as required)

---

## 7. Troubleshooting
- **ImportError for provider APIs:**
  Install missing library or check import path per error message
- **OpenAI API errors:**
  Ensure API key is set & correct, check quota, and test with trivial prompt
- **Incomplete data extraction:**
  Some APIs rate-limit or restrict output—try smaller batch sizes/queries
- **Missing/extra dependencies:**
  `requirements.txt` may need syncing with your environment!
